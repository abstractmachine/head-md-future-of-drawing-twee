[if passage.name == 'Phase-1']
During this phase, we will focus on understanding the Caran d'Ache world, its audience and start mapping our first ideas and research. You will apply the methodologies taught in class. We will start prototyping and pitch our ideas.

[if passage.name == 'Phase-2']
In this phase, we will define some first intentions, user scenarios and possible interaction. We will mainly create paper mock-ups to test and pitch our first ideas. Technical classes will come later.
