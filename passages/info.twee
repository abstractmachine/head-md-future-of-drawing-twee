:: Planning
Phase 1: **Research and experimentation** – `October 16 to October 30`<br>
During this phase, we will focus on understanding the Caran d'Ache world, its audience and strat mapping our first ideas and research. You will apply the methodologies taught in class. We will start prototyping and pitch our ideas. 

Phase 2: **First intentions** – `October 30 - November 4`<br>
In this phase, we will define some first intentions, user scenarios and possible interaction. We will mainly create paper mock-ups to test and pitch our first ideas. Technical classes will come later. 

Phase 3: **Concept** – `November 13 - November 16`<br>
This phase will focus on visualizing your project intention (mock-up, scenario, drawing) and creating a presentation for our mid-crit with Caran d’Ache

Phase 4: **Prototyping** – `November 27 - December 15`<br>
During this phase, you will focus on prototyping your idea (3D, electronics…). You will keep iterating and think about the final details of your interactive object. You will also test your prototype during the test day.

Phase 5: **Final development and presentation** – `December 20 - January 17`<br>
In this phase, you will focus on finishing your project and final production. You will also create all the final assets needed for your presentation and final jury with Caran d’Ache.
