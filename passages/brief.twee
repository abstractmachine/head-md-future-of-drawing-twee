[[Writing->inspiration-allison-parrish]] and [[storytelling->inspiration-pharmako-ai]] serve as foundational elements in digital practices, whether it involves [[composing algorithms->inspiration-compass]] to [[generate->inspiration-allison-parrish]] [[poetry->inspiration-sashastiles]] or [[experimenting->inspiration-tracing-the-line]] with [[drawing->inspiration-jurg-lehni]] [[machines->inspiration-harold-cohen]].

Throughout this project, we aim to explore the following questions:

3. {reveal link: ' ...', passage: 'brief-questions-3'}

:: brief-questions-1
In what forms and with what characteristics could an AI serve as an [[artist's assistant->inspiration-margot-herbelin]]?

:: brief-questions-2
What [[novel combinations->brief-combinations]] and engaging interactions could we envision in this context?

:: brief-questions-3
How might we transcend [[the conventional metaphor->inspiration-ai-bias]] of [[AI as a collaborator->https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak]]?

By novel combinations we mean juxtaposing simple materials in unexpected ways{reveal link: ' ...', passage: 'brief-combinations-1'}

{embed passage: 'Menu'}

:: brief-combinations-1
. This can also be achieved by taking complex "new" technologies and integrating them with familiar technologies or gestures, and thereby simplify their complexity through the poetics of well-understood mechanisms or materials.

For example [[...->brief-combinations-2]]

<image class='right' src='images/caran-creative-class-1-2-3.jpg'>*What we will create*:

In this workshop, our aim is to craft playful AI creative assistants. The element of playfulness will serve as a catalyst for inspiration, encouraging individuals to broaden their artistic horizons. Leveraging the rich offerings of Caran d’Ache's tools, we will conceive a new breed of interactive objects.

Our primary focus will be on designing interactives [[tailored for beginners->inspiration-caran-creative-class]] — those who may not consider themselves artists or professionals and may benefit from additional guidance in their creative journey. Such individuals often require a lighthearted approach to ease into creative activities.

[[→->brief-assistants]]

{embed passage: 'brief-menu'}

These AI creative [[assistants->inspiration-superflux-friends]] will, for instance, introduce fresh and imaginative exercises, or [[encourage people to experiment->inspiration-updatables]] with novel techniques and unexpected color palettes{reveal link: '...', passage: 'brief-assistants-1'}

{embed passage: 'Menu'}

.

The final outcome will be an assortment of [[AI collaborators->inspiration-last-pencil]] designed for creative enthusiasts{reveal link: ' ...', passage: 'brief-assistants-2'}

:: brief-assistants-2
.

For example, one AI collaborator might transform sounds into vibrant hues, while another could suggest innovative gestures{reveal link: ' ...', passage: 'brief-assistants-3'}

:: brief-assistants-3
.

Another might prompt you to explore unfamiliar lines, and yet another could turn the [[act of drawing->inspiration-looom]] into an engaging game{reveal link: ' ...', passage: 'brief-assistants-4'}

4. {reveal link: ' ...', passage: 'brief-rules-4'}
5. {reveal link: ' ...', passage: 'brief-rules-5'}

{embed passage: 'Menu'}

:: brief-rules-1
Your AI collaborator must be interactive and [[mix->inspiration-z-land]] a digital interface with a physical object. Note that the scale of your object can vary according to your concept. 

:: brief-rules-2
Your concept must consider [[the target audience->brief-play]] given in the brief. 

:: brief-rules-3
Your object has to showcase a simple yet playful interaction. Your object must be thought and conceived to be showcased in the context of an exhibition and easily handled by the public. 

:: brief-rules-4
Reduce the number of ingredients (materials, technology, gestures, et cætera) to their strict minimum. It is the novelty of the combinations and not their number that makes for an engaging experience.

:: brief-rules-5
You must participate actively in class discussion, visualize and test your ideas with mock-ups, scenarios, etc…
